/**
 * a coroutine wrapper that manages the yields
 * stack so it can be communicated with the host
 * by yielding
 *
 * this makes some assumptions for how the co-
 * routine should yield and interact. Only guarded 
 * coroutines will follow the rules. So there
 * are the ways to guard a coroutine:
 * 1. coroutine.spawn(func)
 * 2. yield a coroutine in a guarded one
 * 	(any coroutine is yielded from a guarded one
 * 	will run in the guarded mode.
 * 3. spawn from native c++ and schedule to the
 * 	thread
 * 
 * basically, the guarded coroutine will run in
 * a thread where it handles how to yield and
 * resume. any coroutine can turn into guarded
 * mode, but a guarded coroutine that if yielded 
 * will be resumed in the non-guarded mode will
 * cause the system vulnerable because the yielded/
 * suspended guarded coroutine is added in the
 * waiting/polling list, and thus will be resumed
 * again
 *
 * --------
 * The first thought was to have the returns from
 * the "polling functions", which will make asum-
 * ptions on the stack. This will cause inconsit-
 * ensy with the native coroutines, and thus lose 
 * compatibility. So, the coroutine wrapper could
 * presumably wrap any coroutine (either yielded
 * one or a new one), the only thing it'll do is
 * to frequently check trueness of the yielded 
 * values and resume the coroutine. If the coroutine
 * is resumed not by the scheduler, it's fine and
 * it'll be automatically removed from the scheduler
 *
