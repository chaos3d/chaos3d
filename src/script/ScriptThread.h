/**
 * This is a wrapper of the state in a 'thread'.
 * it basically provides API to communicate between
 * threads(states) using messaging, and maintains
 * coroutines to simplify the run loop.
 *
 * thread/coroutine/manager won't interfere the
 * state, it is a tool to schedule existing 
 * coroutines and utilize system threads to 
 * implement multi-threading. so there shouldn't
 * be any function relating to the state
 *
 * -- TODO
 * A script thread is a thread that runs Lua script.
 * it'll handle coroutines (every code runs as a 
 * coroutine) and polling (yielding will poll the
 * state). it should be an independent virtual
 * machine, and communication between script threads
 * is by piping/messaging (see LuaLanes). when an
 * object is being passed, it'll look for the meta
 * method '__retain' (the internal object, i.e. 
 * table can't be retained but copied because it
 * can't be shared among different vm's.
